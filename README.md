# TOS_ST - Timer - One Shot - Restartable - IEC 61131-3 Structured Text

A one-shot (pulse) timer function block similar to standard TP, but with restart (SR) and clear (C) actions.  The SR action can either 'S'tart or 'R'eset the timer, hence the action's name.

See the declaration of TOS.ST for implementation details.

Tested in the CoDeSys V2.3 environment on IFM Classic and NT hardware.
